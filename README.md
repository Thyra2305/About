<h1><strong> Information about the academic </strong></h1>

<p>

Thyra SM van Veen, BA studied Celtic Languages and Culture at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and is currently following the Early Medieval Insular Languages and Culture track of the Research Master, Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies. The subjects that she studied were largely linguistic based – Old Irish and Middle Welsh – with Irish Brehon law and history of the Continental and Insular Celts thrown into the mix. It was in these subjects, along with Celtic folklore and mythology, that she discovered her true academic passion in. Her personal field of interest is anthropological; Thyra enjoys investigating how Irish and Welsh stories and folklore reflected history, cultural beliefs and law texts. Her ambition is to do further research in these subjects, writing academic books and historical fiction.

Thyra is currently working on investigating the duality between man and beast in the Third and Fourth Branches of the Mabinogi, with an emphasis on naming and baptsim. For her Master's thesis, she will be investigating the extent to which the concept of the "benevolent werewolf" is a phenomenon only seen in Insular Celtic werewolves, or if it is also seen in English and - possibly - Scandanavian werewolves, as well.
